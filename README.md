# Smart-Plant-Monitoring-System
This project is an IoT-based Smart Plant Monitoring System designed to ensure optimal care for your plants by providing real-time monitoring and alerts. Built with the ESP8266, Blynk, and multiple sensors, the system tracks crucial environmental factors such as:

‚¶ø üå°Ô∏è Temperature
‚¶ø üíß Humidity
‚¶ø üìè Water Level

Features
‚¶ø Real-Time Monitoring: View live sensor data through a mobile app.
‚¶ø Instant Alerts: Receive notifications when environmental thresholds are breached.
‚¶ø User-Friendly Design: Easy-to-use mobile app with seamless IoT connectivity.
‚¶ø Efficient Sensor Integration: Accurate and reliable data collection for optimized 
  plant care.

Tech Stack
‚¶ø Microcontroller: ESP8266
‚¶ø Platform: Blynk IoT
‚¶ø Sensors: Temperature, Humidity, and Water Level

Applications
‚¶ø Indoor plant care
‚¶ø Smart gardening solutions
‚¶ø Agricultural automation

How It Works
1.Sensors collect real-time data on plant conditions.
2.The ESP8266 sends the data to the Blynk IoT platform.
3.The mobile app displays the data and triggers alerts if any parameter falls outside 
  the desired range.
